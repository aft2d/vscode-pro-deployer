All other settings will be used according to the active workspace. When use `pro-deployer.upload-all-open` or `pro-deployer.download-all-files` will be uploaded/downloaded files from the selected target workspace.

## Usage

1. Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows/Linux or Cmd+Shift+P on Mac open command palette, run `PRO Deployer: Generate Config File`.
2. Now you should have a new menu item `PRO Deployer` in the context menu of the file explorer or in opened files. Also, you can run commands from the command palette. If you is enabled `uploadOnSave` option, on file save will be uploaded automatically.
3. Enjoy.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

1. `Alt+U` - upload file
2. `Alt+D` - download file

## Upload to Specific Target via Keybinding

You can bind a specific target to a keyboard shortcut by passing the `target` argument to the `pro-deployer.upload-to` command in your `keybindings.json`.

```json
{
    "key": "ctrl+alt+1",
    "command": "pro-deployer.upload-to",
    "args": { "target": "My SFTP" }
},
{
    "key": "ctrl+alt+2",
    "command": "pro-deployer.upload-to",
    "args": { "target": "My FTP" }
}
```

## Example Configs

Config file location: `${workspaceFolder}/.vscode/pro-deployer.json`

### Variable Substitution

PRO Deployer supports VS Code-like variables in configuration values. This is useful for creating dynamic configurations that adapt to different workspaces.

**Supported Variables:**

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `${workspaceFolder}` | The path of the workspace folder |
| `${workspaceFolderBasename}` | The name of the workspace folder without path |
| `${userHome}` | The path of the user's home folder |
| `${pathSeparator}` | The character used to separate path components |
| `${env:VARIABLE_NAME}` | The value of an environment variable |

**Example with dynamic directory:**

```js
{
    "targets": [
        {
            "name": "My SFTP",
            "type": "sftp",
            "host": "example.com",
            "user": "admin",
            "password": "123456",
            "dir": "/var/www/${workspaceFolderBasename}"  // Uses workspace folder name
        }
    ]
}
```

This allows you to use the same configuration template across multiple workspaces, and the `dir` will automatically resolve to the workspace folder name (e.g., `/var/www/my-project`).

### Full Configuration Example

```js
{
    "enableStatusBarItem": true, //enable extension status bar item
